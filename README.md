Regression and classification with random forests in Stata

`version 0.3 8jul2020`


Overview
---------------------------------

pyforest has been replaced with a larger package, [pylearn](https://github.com/mdroste/stata-pylearn), which provides the same functionality for random forests (plus more!) in a common interface with other supervised learning algorithms (e.g. neural networks, decision trees, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting). Please visit the pylearn project page for more information.
